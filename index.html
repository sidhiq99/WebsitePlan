        Mursala waterfall is located on Mursala Island which is between Sumatra Island and Nias Island, precisely in Central Tapanuli Regency. With a height of around 35 meters, the water flows over reddish black granite rocks and then falls onto the surface of the Indian Ocean with a thunderous sound.
